				<h3>Kwan's Hierarchy of Product Needs: How to architect an Agile organization from Startup to Maturity</h3>
				<h4>02:15 PM – Brunswick</h4>
				<p>
				What part does Product Management play in an Agile development team?  It changes depending on the stage of the company. In this session, we will break down the product needs at every stage of a company's growth. You will find out whether your Agile team's product needs are being met and how you might identify and mitigate any gaps. Then we will discuss how product managers can successfully partner with engineering leaders to enable Agile at seed stage and at scale.

				<h3>Kanban Antipatterns</h3>
				<h4>09:30 AM – Hanover</h4>
				<p>
				In this interactive workshop we will examine multiple examples of Antipatterns observed in real-world Kanban boards. In each case we will identify the issues and discuss ways to improve the situation.  We will review a number of better alternatives and see how the improvements map to the core principles of Kanban such as visualization, managing flow, and making policies explicit.  Brand new to Kanban?  Learning by example is a great way to get started!   A long-time Kanban veteran?  Come to see how many antipatterns you recognize and help firm up our Kanban Antipattern taxonomy and nomenclature!
				<br/><br/>
				Kanban is an extremely versatile and effective Agile method that has seen significant growth in popularity over recent years.   Kanban's flexibility has led to widespread adoption to manage business processes in disparate contexts such as HR, loan processing, drug discovery, and insurance underwriting, in addition to Information Technology.  Like snowflakes, no two Kanban boards are alike

				<h3>Waterfall Or Iterative Delivery, Business Or IT! The World Needs Braver Leaders!</h3>
				<h4>10:45 AM – Hanover</h4>
				<p>
				LEADER: Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes and has the courage to develop that potential. - Brené Brown
				<br/><br/>
				What if you weren't born to be a leader? What if your "boss" isn't a good leader? Should you worry? Should you give up, "fall in line," and wait for others to show you the way?
				<br/><br/>
				Positively, absolutely, without any doubt, NO!
				<br/><br/>
				Leadership is a skill that is teachable, observable, and measurable! Leadership is not about titles or the corner office. It's about the willingness to step up, put yourself out there, and lean into courage - and help others discover their potential. Let's explore leadership through the work of BrenÃ© Brown's twenty years of studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy and her recent seven-year study on brave leadership. The world is desperate for brave leaders. Join us as we dive into the 4 skill sets of Brave Leadership. It's time for all of us to step up, help each other, and create something better.

				<h3>Adaptive Leadership...WTF is that?</h3>
				<h4>09:30 AM – Powhatan</h4>
				<p>
				"The single biggest failure of leadership is to treat adaptive challenges like technical problems." -Ron Heifetz 
				<br/><br/>
				We live and work in an increasingly interconnected and rapidly changing world. New business models are shifting duties to teams instead of individuals, which means people are now working more closely together. It also means leaders at all levels have to begin to adapt their leadership style to guide the intricacies of human dynamics and channel the collective knowledge of the groups they interact with. 
				<br/><br/>
				In this workshop we will explore how leaders create environments that navigate the complexity of interpersonal relationships, overcome the human element of barriers to change, and support the growth and engagement of their employees. Attendees will walk out of the room with a clearer idea of their own leadership style and a list of action items they can use (tomorrow!) to move their teams one step closer to higher performance.

				<h3>I Spy With My Little Eye: Using Metrics to Coach Change</h3>
				<h4>01:00 PM – Henrico A</h4>
				<p>
				Are you using agility metrics to guide your continuous improvement or do they act like a measuring stick? What if instead, we viewed agility metrics as "magnifying glass"? When the right metrics are used in the right context they can be a safe way to show areas that may need some "help." Come learn how to Read, Reflect, React, and Respond to agility metrics. This session will be workshop style with full attendee participation.

				  My focus is to improve the world by improving its systems. As the International and Small Business Program Lead for Productivity Metrics and a member of the Continuous Improvement Leadership Team, I manage complexity by accepting that complexity and uncertainty are natural to social systems and knowledge work. I believe effective systems must produce better outcomes. System development requires a holistic approach that incorporates the human condition. I am committed to exploring valuable ideas from all disciplines, and fostering a community that derives solutions from a common set of values and principles, while embracing specific context and avoiding dogma.

				<h3>10 Steps to Better Outcomes by Using Metrics</h3>
				<h4>09:30 AM – Henrico A</h4>
				<p>
				This session is not intended to offer an exhaustible list of metrics or instructions on how to improve all systems. Rather, the intent is to provide a framework on how to ensure the quantitative and qualitative metrics you use are measuring the right things and how to apply them to a system of continuous improvement. 
				<br/><br/>
				The session is broken into two main parts.
				<br/><br/>
				Part 1: Create a cycle of learning and improvement that aligns people and teams to the outcomes or goals.<br/>
				Part 2: Identify the right (quantitative and qualitative) metrics that will help people and teams meet outcomes or goals.

				<h3>Data Driven Delivery - A Path to High-Performance in 6 Months</h3>
				<h4>10:45 AM – Henrico A</h4>
				<p>
				You've been tasked with developing a high-performing team that produces quality work in a timely manner; it's your job to figure out how. Product teams leverage data and experimentation to conduct discovery, test hypotheses, and decipher results.  But how can we use these techniques to improve your team's delivery?  
				<br/><br/>
				In this session, we will explore how to determine when change is needed, what data to leverage, and how to determine if the change was valuable! We'll give you a practical guide for applying proven toolsets in a unique, methodical manner to drive product delivery results.

				<h3>Story Crafting for Change Agents</h3>
				<h4>02:15 PM – Hanover A</h4>
				<p>
				During the journey towards greater Agility, it can be a challenge to communicate those moments of success that can act as a beacon to teams reluctant to try something new. Often the triumphs are hidden amongst information on the mechanics of Agile transformations: implementation of frameworks, methods, and data.
				<br/><br/>
				However, we process our world in narrative, we talk in narrative and most important for leadership, people recall and retain information more effectively when it's presented in the form of a story.
				<br/><br/>
				This workshop is based on the experiences of starting a practice of storytelling within a large healthcare organization midway through an Agile transformation. It will introduce key ideas used to tell a story that sticks.Participants will experience techniques from the world of improv theatre to illustrate these ideas.

				<h3>Risk: A Bias Toward Action</h3>
				<h4>01:00 PM – Henrico B</h4>
				<p>
				At the tactical, operational and strategic levels, there is always a bias when assessing risk. Jason will explain the types of situations he has personally encountered during his career as a Navy SEAL and map them to principles that relate to technology, software development, and business in general.  While risk management has life or death implications in the military, the consequences for a business can be similarly financially and reputationally devestating.

				<h3>Responding to Change over Following a Plan: Agile Lessons from Antarctica</h3>
				<h4>01:00 PM – Hanover</h4>
				<p>
				I spent January 2018 in Antarctica hanging out with penguins, whales, and seals. It was as different from my day-to-day work as can be. And yet, I couldn't help but reflect on how my trip aligned with a value of the Agile Manifesto: "Responding to change over following a plan."
				<br/><br/>
				It's a common misconception that there's no need to plan in Agile. While this isn't the case, and specific approaches do change, the act of planning still has great value when it occurs at the right level. Still, we accept that many things will change and we'll need to remain flexible.
				<br/><br/>
				Nowhere is this truer than in Antarctica. In this session, I'll share how my trip drove home why we need both planning AND, even more importantly, the ability to respond to change, and not just in software development. And after getting stuck in Antarctica, it also built up my empathy for team members struggling with dynamic situations!

				<h3>KonMari Your Backlog: Tidying up those PBIs</h3>
				<h4>10:45 AM – Powhatan</h4>
				<p>
				Have you tidied your personal life with Marie Kondo and are wondering how to achieve the same effect at work? Are your most valuable product backlog items lost under a mountain of old stories? Join us to learn how to make your product better through the life changing magic of tidying your backlog. 
				<br/><br/>
				We'll start by exploring the costs of a large, cluttered backlog and share a quiz you can use to gauge your backlog's current state. Next, we'll cover how we've adapted the KonMari method to five easy steps you can take to get started in your tidying process. We'll share real-life examples, calling out potential pitfalls to avoid and illustrating how story mapping may be the magical backlog equivalent to Kondo's "vertical folding" technique. By the end of the session, you'll know the specific next steps to take so that you too can realize the many benefits of a tidied-up product backlog: improved visibility, increased self-organization, and easier decision-making.

				<h3>Mixed Agile Arts:  What can Agile Coaches learn from the UFC</h3>
				<h4>10:45 AM – Chesterfield</h4>
				<p>
				Martial Arts have been around for thousands of years, and it takes practitioners decades to truly master an individual discipline.  The UFC emerged in the early 1990s as a way to pit individual martial arts against another to determine which art was superior.  As it turned out, the most effective method of combat was a blending of individual arts into what we today refer to as Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).  While Agile isn't thousands of years old, it has given way to many different disciplines.  You may have seen or been part of some fairly passionate debate on which Agile "art" is more effective.  Scrum  vs Kanban, SAFe vs LeSS, LeanUX vs Design Thinking.  In this session, we will explore a Mixed Agile Arts approach to problem solving.  Rather than debate the efficacy of one practice over the other, let's pull from many different frameworks to create a more dynamic approach to building better products, inspiring teams, and engaging everyone in a transformation.

				<h3>Organizational Transformation</h3>
				<h4>10:45 AM – Spotsylvania</h4>
				<p>
				Historically, this talk has focused heavily on our theory and approach - the 3 things, the 4 Quadrants, the 10 Circles, etc. But, as we've matured, so has the Agile community. Now, we believe that the community is ready to for the next phase. So, instead of just talking about  why organizations want to go Agile, and what actually needs  to Transform - we're taking a deep dive into our change model and discussing how to orchestrate the change, and who should be orchestrating it. Additionally, we've developed some new terminology and enabling structures that didn't exist even a year ago.

				<h3>Peaks or Valleys? The Power of Scaling Agility in the Alphabet Soup of Government Agencies</h3>
				<h4>10:45 AM – Brunswick</h4>
				<p>
				Do you feel like Agile Scaling has become a goal rather than the means to an end for your organization? To determine where you stand on the Scaling spectrum, ask yourself a few soul-searching questions: Why do we need to scale? Is this the right time for us to scale? If you've checked these boxes, you may wonder "where do I go from here?"
				<br/><br/>
				This talk will focus on 3 areas that emerged as common themes throughout my experience working on government Agile Scaling projects and ultimately influenced the trajectory of each agency's scaling journey:
				<br/><br/>
				Communicate vision consistently<br/>
				Focus on your people genuinely<br/>
				Create your own path intentionally
				<br/><br/>
				I've seen successes and some struggles with Agile Scaling efforts in government agencies. Regardless of the agency acronym or the frameworks used, these key elements shaped their scaling outcomes.

				<h3>Stop Coachsplaing! Mentoring for REAL Rather Than Talking at People</h3>
				<h3>Co-Presenter: Braz Brandt</h3>
				<h4>09:30 AM – Chesterfield</h4>
				<p>
				As Agile Coaches we straddle the fine line between "expert" and "coach". We work tirelessly to create the right environment and ask the best questions to unlock the goodness in those around us. Sometimes, though, we get asked a question or facilitate something, and we forget. We get excited. We get on a roll and jump into expert mode and forget to come back up for air. We start "coachsplaining".
				<br/><br/>
				In this workshop, we will discover how to probe continuously to ensure we are still listening and questioning when we are in a mentoring conversation.

				<h3>Innovation:  Leveraging Advances in Neuroscience and Learning Theory to Optimize your Thinking!</h3>
				<h4>09:30 AM – Henrico B</h4>
				<p>
				Organizations are being challenged with thinking differently and creating new approaches and products. In today's Digital Transformation era, teams are required to work and think in different ways to accelerate their overall digital transformation and agile maturity.  Scientific research in human behavior and learning has created new concepts that can be applied to our business agility.  In this session, we will discuss scientific principles of human behavior and learning and how these apply to today's workforce and our agile processes.  In addition, we will see these behavior in action in the context of an innovation framework process that can applied to projects and products.

				<h3>Applying Lean Startup & Lean UX Cycle with a Rolling Wave Feedback Based Roadmap </h3>
				<h3>Co-Presenter: Michelle Warner</h3>
				<h4>09:30 AM – Henrico B</h4>
				<p>
				When we live in a world of Newtonian order, there is a clear relationship between cause and effect, companies can predict / decide what strategies they want to pursue. 
				<br/><br/>
				Today's wicked world involves many stakeholders with changing market conditions & thereby priorities, in strategy & investment meetings dealing with incomplete and / or contradictory knowledge, and opinions, where issue's roots are tangled, and issue symptoms keep changing with every attempt to address them with complex possibilities. 
				<br/><br/>
				Enterprises don't know if their strategies are appropriate or what those strategies' consequences might be. 
				<br/><br/>
				Let me share what Lean Enterprises can do to "tame" these wicked problem(s) in line with anecdotes from my consulting experience applying Lean Startup & Lean UX Cycle with a rolling wave feedback based roadmap and abandoning the convention of thinking big upfront committed annual roadmap with a single target state.

				<h3>Quantifying Risk with a DevOps Credit Score</h3>
				<h4>10:45 AM – Spotsylvania</h4>
				<p>
				Exploring the history of the DevOps movement as it began to emerge from Agile conferences in the early 2000's, we'll arrive at a broad definition of the term that's familiar to nearly every organization. This definition will frame the context for how story creation and prioritization of actual technical solutions in our Agile processes can be optimized. Finally we will look at how to build a "credit score" for DevOps (or your entire IT organization) that can grow and be customized to the demands of your organization.

				<h3>Transformation Hiccups - Emphasis on Technology or Alignment to Business Objective or Vice-Versa?</h3>
				<h4>09:30 AM – Brunswick</h4>
				<p>
				Today Industry across various organizations is on a journey towards multiple transformation initiatives with the core aspect of bringing Business Agility to their existing construct. As they embark on the journey of transformation initiatives unfortunately each initiative operates in siloes due to reasons across limited Perspective, Partial Collaboration and Inefficient Execution approach.
				<br/><br/>
				The Organization Culture and hence the Mindset restricts their thoughts towards being able to transform across areas of Overall Strategy, Customer Experience, Products (& Services), People, Organization and Technology. What is the intrinsic motivation behind driving towards this huge initiative and the desire to adopting to change.
